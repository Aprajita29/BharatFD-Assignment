To run this application, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or later)
 Install MongoDB and make sure it's running
 Install Redis and make sure it's running


2. Set up the project:

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Configure the project:

1. Open faq_project/settings.py
2. Update the SECRET_KEY with a secure random string
3. If your MongoDB setup is different from the default (localhost:27017), update the DATABASES configuration



4. Set up the database:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate



5. Create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser



6. Run the development server:


python manage.py runserver



7. Access the application:

1. Admin panel: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)
2. API: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/faqs/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/faqs/)





As for how much work you have to do, it depends on your specific requirements and the current state of the project. Here's a breakdown:

1. Basic Setup: The provided code is a functional Django application with MongoDB integration. If your requirements align with what's provided, you might not need to do much additional work.
2. Google Translate API: The current implementation uses the googletrans library, which is an unofficial library and might be unstable. For a production environment, you should consider using the official Google Cloud Translation API, which would require some additional setup and code changes.
3. Testing: While there are some basic tests provided, you might want to expand the test coverage to ensure all features work as expected, especially after integrating with MongoDB.
4. Frontend: This is a backend-only project. If you need a frontend, you'll have to build that separately.
5. Deployment: The provided setup is for a development environment. For production, you'll need to:

1. Set up a production-ready MongoDB instance
2. Set up a production-ready Redis instance
3. Configure Django for production (set DEBUG to False, configure allowed hosts, etc.)
4. Set up a production web server like Gunicorn
5. Possibly set up Nginx as a reverse proxy



6. Security: Ensure all sensitive information (like database credentials) are stored securely, preferably as environment variables.
7. Performance Optimization: Depending on your expected load, you might need to optimize database queries and caching strategies.
8. Error Handling and Logging: Implement more robust error handling and logging for production use.
